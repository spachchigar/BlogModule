  JSS Sitecore Configuration Patch File

  This configuration file registers the JSS site with Sitecore, and configures the Layout Service
  to work with it. Config patches need to be deployed to the Sitecore server.

  Normally `jss deploy config` can do this for local development. To manually deploy, or to deploy via CI,
  this file can be placed in the `App_Config/Include` folder, or a subfolder of it, within the Sitecore site.

    <!--
      Note that if any of these settings are enabled, they will apply to the entire Sitecore instance. If there are
      multiple sites defined in the instances, the settings will affect all of them.

        ANALYTICS FORWARDED REQUEST HEADER
        When using Next.js SSR routes, Layout Service requests will send the original IP address of the client on the 'X-Forwarded-For' header.
        This setting tells Sitecore to read the forwarded header, thus making analytics track the correct original client IP address.

        <setting name="Analytics.ForwardedRequestHttpHeader" set:value="X-Forwarded-For" />
      -->
      
      <!--
        ANALYTICS DISABLE ROBOT DETECTION
        During development, activity will flag us as a robot.
        These settings will enable tracking of robot activity for ease of testing (development ONLY).
        
        <setting name="Analytics.AutoDetectBots" set:value="false" />
        <setting name="Analytics.Robots.IgnoreRobots" set:value="false" />

      <!--
        JSS EDITING SECRET
        To secure the Sitecore editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app (see `serverSideRenderingEngineEndpointUrl` below),
        a secret token is used. This is taken from an env variable by default, but could be patched and set directly by uncommenting.
        This (server-side) value must match your client-side value, which is configured by the JSS_EDITING_SECRET env variable (see the Next.js .env file).
        We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

      -->
        <setting name="JavaScriptServices.ViewEngine.Http.JssEditingSecret" value="A180B8F6025C4A25AB3211F9CA1BC15C" />

      <!--
        LANGUAGE FALLBACK
        These settings enable item-level language fallback for JSS apps that use Experience Edge.
        In addition to these settings, ensure that Language Fallback is configured on the Language
        item in Sitecore, and that items in the content tree have "Enable Item Fallback" field set
        to true. Other settings related to item-level language fallback that may exist in Sitecore
        configuration will not impact Edge functionality.

        <setting name="ExperienceEdge.EnableItemLanguageFallback" value="true"/>
        <setting name="ExperienceEdge.EnableFieldLanguageFallback" value="true"/>
      -->
    </settings>
